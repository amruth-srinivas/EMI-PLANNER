# EMI-PLANNER

 This project combines an EMI calculator and a loan prediction feature based on the 
customer's salary and expenses. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows 
individuals to calculate their Equated Monthly Instalments (EMI) accurately. By 
considering the principal loan amount, interest rate, and tenure, the calculator provides a 
detailed breakdown of the monthly instalments, interest paid, and outstanding balance for 
each month. It aims to bridge the gap in existing EMI calculators by offering a 
comprehensive solution that considers individual financial circumstances. With its userfriendly interface and accurate calculations, it serves as a valuable tool for individuals 
seeking financial planning assistance and loan management support.
